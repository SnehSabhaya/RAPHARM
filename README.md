The healthcare sector faces a challenge in providing comprehensive care for patients with upper and lower limb impairments.Upper limb-impaired individuals often confront hurdles in executing basic tasks like self-feeding or manipulating objects, leading to feelings of dependency. On the other hand, lower limb-impaired patients encounter mobility issues and require aid in wheelchair navigation and accessing nearby items. This project aims to incorporates a cutting-edge 6 Degree of Freedom (6 DoF) robotic arm integrated onto a wheelchair enabling voice commands for upper limb-impaired individuals and joystick control for lower limb-impaired patients.
